# Space_Wars_Game
This is the repository for my first pygame project in a while, which is a local multiplayer game.

Left Spaceship controls:

WASD - Movement
Left Ctrl - Shoot bullets

Right Spaceship controls:

Arrow keys - Movement
Right Ctrl - Shoot bullets

Help:

Fork the repo and run the main.py to run the game. You need to have the pygame module installed.
The two spaceships have an initial health of 10, and each bullet reduces the health by 1.
If the health of any spaceship reduces to 0, the game is over with the other spaceship being declared the winner.
